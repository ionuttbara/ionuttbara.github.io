    <h3>Digital Rights in Romania</h3>
    <p>As both a technology professional and political activist, I believe digital rights are fundamental to modern democracy.</p>
    <p>Romania faces significant challenges in balancing security needs with citizen privacy rights, especially in digital communications and data protection.</p>
    <p>Technology should empower citizens, not enable surveillance. We need stronger protections for digital privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
    <p>Digital tools can be powerful weapons against corruption when used transparently. My activism in Damuc has shown how technology can expose corruption.</p>
