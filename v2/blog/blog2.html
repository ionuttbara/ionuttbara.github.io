            <h2>Starting the Master's Program</h2>
            <p>Beginning my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at UMFST Targu Mures has been an incredible journey. The program combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications that directly benefit my work at Electricon.</p>

            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working on several AI projects:</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning for System Optimization</h3>
            <p>Applying ML algorithms to predict system performance bottlenecks and automatically apply optimization tweaks - similar to what the Melody Script does, but with intelligent decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Neural Networks for Security Analysis</h3>
            <p>Developing neural networks that can analyze system behavior and detect potential security threats without relying on traditional antivirus signatures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Balancing Work and Studies</h2>
            <p>Managing my responsibilities at Electricon while pursuing advanced AI studies requires careful time management. The practical experience from my IT work often provides real-world contexts for academic concepts.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Applications</h2>
            <p>I'm excited about applying AI techniques to improve the tools and services I offer, potentially creating more intelligent versions of existing utilities like the Defender Remover and Melody Script.</p>
